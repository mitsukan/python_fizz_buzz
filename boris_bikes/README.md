## Unblocking

As Python is built with OOP, I've made a lot of assumptions in how similar Python is compared to Ruby.

The first thing Throwing me off is how the modules work, in that it's an extra top layer vs Ruby.

### Classes

I made some liberties in guessing my way through how classes work. I understand that all classes created inherit from the object class, similar in how Ruby has certain things inheriting from others at a higher level.

I did run into the problem of testing classes!
In order to unblock myself, I double checked how the class syntaxing works via Codecademy, and then checked the Python documentation. They had [this awesome page](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/580811-uno-text-based/) in the beginners guide of their website where you can look at some example code.
It showed me that other than a little bit less syntaxic sugar (such as having to manually specify that each method/function is referring to `self`), that it really does work extremely similarly to Ruby.
